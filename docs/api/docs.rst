.. automodule:: invocations.docs

.. TODO: fuck me sideways tasks don't show up AT ALL even tho Task copies __doc__ - what other @decorator shit do I gotta do so it works?

.. TODO: also, fuck, how to square "don't bother writing functions as private, instead rely on @task" with "whoops I want ONLY the tasks to be documented and NOT the private shit"? Feels like suck it up, write functions as private anyways, and just fix @task? Alternately, write my own ..automodule:: or thing like fab 1 unwrap_docs()??
